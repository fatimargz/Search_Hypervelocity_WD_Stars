# Search_Hypervelocity_WD_Stars
Undergraduate Research with Dr. Ken Shen from the Astronomy Department at UC Berkeley.
In this project, I searched for hypervelocity white dwarf stars that result form Type Ia supernova progenitor scenarios in GPS1 and Gaia data.
This project was started in the Summer 2020.
