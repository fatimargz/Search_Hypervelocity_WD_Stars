# Search_Hypervelocity_WD_Stars
The following was my undergraduate research project with Dr. Ken Shen from the UC Berkeley Astronomy Department. In this code, I search for hypervelocity white dwarf (WD) survivors from Type Ia supernova in the Gaia-PS1-SDSS (GPS1) Proper Motion Catalog by creating queries,proper motion diagrams, and color-color diagrams in Python. I also plot the three D^6 hypervelocity runaways found by Shen et al. ([2018](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aad55b)) and the theoretical evolutionary sequences for hydrogen- and helium-atmosphere WDs [[3](http://www.astro.umontreal.ca/~bergeron/CoolingModels/)].   

## Motivation
A possible cause to Type Ia supernova are "dynamically driven double-degenerate double detontation" (D^6) scenarios; in other words, double detonations in double white dwarf (WD) binaries undergoing unstale mass transfer. If true, it is predicted that the companion WD survives the supernova and flung with a velocity equal to its  pre-SN orbital velocity (>1000 km/s). So far three hypervelocity runaway WDs have been found using Gaia's second data release highlighted by Shen et al. ([2018](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aad55b)); however the number of runaway WDs nearby is estimated to be around 28 (23)[[1](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aad55b)]. Given this theoretical motivation, I attempt to look for the missing estimated runaway WDs using proper motion diagrams and the Gaia-PS1-SDSS (GPS1) Proper Motion Catalog [[2](https://dc.zah.uni-heidelberg.de/__system__/dc_tables/show/tableinfo/gps1.main)].
