# Search_Hypervelocity_WD_Stars
The following was my undergraduate research project with Dr. Ken Shen from the UC Berkeley Astronomy Department. In this code, I searched for hypervelocity white dwarf survivors from Type Ia supernova in the Gaia-PS1-SDSS (GPS1) Proper Motion Catalog by creating queries and proper motion diagrams in Python. 

# Motivation
A possible cause to Type Ia supernova are "dynamically driven double-degenerate double detontation" (D^6) scenarios; in other words, double detonations in double white dwarf (WD) binaries undergoing unstale mass transfer. If true, it is predicted that the companion WD survives the supernova and flung with a velocity equal to its  pre-SN orbital velocity (>1000 km/s). So far three hypervelocity runaway WDs have been found using Gaia's second data release highlighted by Shen et al. (2018); however the number of runaway WDs nearby is estimated to be around 28 (23)[1]. Given this theoretical motivation, I attempt to look for the missing estimated runaway WDs using proper motion diagrams and the Gaia-PS1-SDSS (GPS1) Proper Motion Catalog [2].
